# CRUD Laravel

CRUD Laravel is an application that handles the data with the Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) approach. It's build with Bootstrap [Front-end] and Laravel [Back-end]. At the same time, the application was created which is to understand and learn about the following approach in the back-end framework from the tutorial website called [LaravelCode](https://www.laravelcode.com/). Here's the tutorial about the [Laravel 8 - CRUD application tutorial with Example](https://www.laravelcode.com/post/laravel-8-crud-application-tutorial-with-example)
